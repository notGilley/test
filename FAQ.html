            <h2>1. What is the process of building a computer?</h2>
            <p>Building a computer involves selecting compatible components such as the CPU, motherboard, RAM, storage, power supply, and case. These components are then assembled, connected, and configured to work together. After assembly, the system is tested to ensure it functions correctly, and an operating system is installed.</p>

It ensures that the components are installed correctly, the system is tested for stability, and any potential issues are resolved. This fee compensates for the professional service provided, saving you time and ensuring a reliable build.</p>
